Checklist

1. Correct Movie Completely
There should be zero tracking errors.
You will have a "poly_seq.mat" file saved in the seg folder if you have corrected the movie.


2.  Select Cells for Elongation (elon cells)

3.  Inspect Elongation Chart to find a shift value (view elon)

4. Find the frame at which elongation begins.
The variable 'shift_info' is equal to the number of frames the movie 
needs to be shifted to the RIGHT. If the movie begins before t=0 (elongation begins),
then it needs to be shifted to the LEFT and the shift info is a negative number. 
e.g. if elongation starts at frame 20, then the shift_info = -20.

5. Save the shift_info

6. Make sure the 'timestep' is saved
The 'timestep' is the number of seconds between frames

7.  Select Cells used for cell rearrangement calculations (topo cells).
The default criterion is that a cell must be tracked within the ROI poly
for at least  50 frames after the onset of elongation.

Things to Double Check:
8. If you have a z shift in time, or you have more than one z layer projected per time point, 
then you need a 'z_shift' file that specifies the z_layer at each time point.
