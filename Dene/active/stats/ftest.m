function [p, f] = ftest(d1, d2)
%FTEST F-test for two samples.
%       FTEST(X1, X2) gives the probability that the F value
%       calculated as the rati of the variances of the two samples is
%       greater than observed, i.e. the significance level.
%       [P, F] = FTEST(X1, X2) gives the probability P and returns
%       the value of F.
%
%       A small value of P would lead to reject the hypothesis that
%       both data sets are sampled from distributions with the same
%       variances.
