function [p, t] = ttest(d1, d2)
%TTEST Student's t-test for equal variances.
%       TTEST(X1, X2) gives the probability that Student's t
%       calculated on data X1 and X2, sampled from distributions
%       with the same variance, is higher than observed, i.e.
%       the "significance" level. This is used to test whether
%       two sample have significantly different means.
%       [P, T] = TTEST(X1, X2) gives this probability P and the
%       value of Student's t in T. The smaller P is, the more
%       significant the difference between the means.
%       E.g. if P = 0.05 or 0.01, it is very likely that the
%       two sets are sampled from distributions with different
%       means.
%
%       This works if the samples are drawn from distributions with
%       the SAME VARIANCE. Otherwise, use UTTEST.
